## Description 

### Purpose
The purpose of my portfolio was to create a sleek and efficient design which showcases my
skills as a junior Web Developer. Along the way my main objective was to create a light and
vibrant atmosphere which will engage my target audience within the first instance of
opening the web page. My pages showcase basic and direct information for users to read
and digest content in a timely manner which is not only visually appealing but also direct in
terms of information provided.
